Here’s a line-by-line explanation of my C++ program, breaking down its functionality.

#include <iostream> allows us to use cin, cout, and other standard input-output operations.

#include <cstring> enables handling of C-style strings, like copying and comparing them.

struct MenuItem defines food menu items, each having a name (stored as a character array) and a price.

struct MenuItem → Creates a structure to store food details.

char name[30]; → Stores the food name as a character array (up to 30 characters).

float price; → Stores the price of the food item.

Purpose
This ensures each menu item has a name and price, making it easy to manage food selections in the program.
MenuItem menu[20] → Creates an array that can hold up to 20 menu items.

{ "Burger", 8.99 }, { "Pizza", 12.99 }, { "Salad", 6.49 }, { "Soda", 1.99 }  → These are four food items, each with a name and price.

menuSize = 4; → This tells the program that only 4 items are currently in the menu, even though the array can store up to 20 items.

lass Order {
protected:
    MenuItem** items; // Dynamic array of food items
    int nItems; // Number of items in the order
    float subtotal; // Total cost before additional fees
    int orderId; // Unique order identifier
    static int nextId; // Tracks the next available order ID
Order is a base class that represents all types of orders.

It holds an array of pointers (MenuItem** items) to store food items dynamically.

subtotal calculates the total cost before fees.

orderId gives each order a unique ID number.

nextId ensures each order has a different ID.

Order() → This is the constructor, which runs automatically when a new order is created.

items(NULL) → Sets items to NULL, meaning the order starts with no selected items.

nItems(0) → Initializes nItems to zero because the order has no items yet.

subtotal(0.0f) → Starts subtotal at $0.00, since nothing has been added.

orderId = nextId++ → Assigns a unique order ID using nextId, then increases nextId for the next order.


    virtual ~Order() {
        delete[] items; // Frees memory when the order is deleted
    }
Ensures allocated memory is freed when an order is removed.

 virtual float calcTotal() = 0;
This function must be defined by derived classes (DineInOrder or DeliveryOrder).

It calculates the final total with fees.


 void addItem(int menuIndex) {
        if (menuIndex < 0 || menuIndex >= menuSize) return;
Checks if the selected item index is valid.

If invalid, it does nothing.

 MenuItem** newItems = new MenuItem*[nItems + 1];  :
Creates a new array to store existing items plus the new item.


          for (int i = 0; i < nItems; i++) {
            *(newItems + i) = *(items + i); // Copy old items
        }
Copies existing items into the new array.

subtotal += menu[menuIndex].price; :Updates subtotal with the price of the new item.

cpp
        delete[] items; // Free old array
        items = newItems; // Update pointer to new array
        nItems++;
    }
Deletes the old array to free memory.

Points to the new array with added items.

for (int i = 0; i < nItems; i++) → Repeats for each item in the order.

std::cout << "- " << items[i]->name << " ($" << items[i]->price << ")\n"; → Displays the item's name and price.

std::cout << → Displays text on the screen.

"Subtotal: $" → Shows the label "Subtotal: $" before the actual amount.

subtotal → Displays the current order total (before fees).

"\n" → Moves to a new line after printing.

void print() → Defines a function that prints order details.

Order::print(); → Calls the base class function to print order items and subtotal.

std::cout << "Delivery fee: $5.00\n"; → Displays the fixed $5.00 delivery fee.

std::cout << "Total: $" << calcTotal() << "\n"; → Prints the final

class OrderManager {
    Order** orders; // Dynamic array of order pointers
    int orderCount; // Number of orders
    int capacity; // Array capacity
Stores multiple orders dynamically.
 
for (int i = 0; i < orderCount; i++) → Loops through all existing orders.

newOrders[i] = orders[i]; → Copies each old order into the new storage array.

delete[] orders; → Deletes the old array to free memory.

orders = newOrders; → Updates the orders list with the newly resized array.

Purpose
When the order list becomes full, this function doubles the storage space so new orders can be added. 

void addOrder(Order* order) → Defines a function that takes a new order (order) as input.

if (orderCount == capacity) resize(); → Checks if storage is full. If yes, it expands the storage space.

orders[orderCount++] = order; → Stores the new order in the list and updates the count.

Purpose
This function ensures that new orders are stored properly, expanding memory when needed.

orderCount--; → Decreases the total number of orders by 1 after removing an order.

return true; → Confirms the order was found and deleted successfully.

return false; → If the order was not found, it returns false, meaning no changes were made.

Purpose
It ensures that when an order is removed, the order count updates correctly, and the function tells the program if the removal was successful or not.

void printAll() → Defines a function to show all orders.

std::cout << "\n=== ALL ORDERS ===\n"; → Prints a title for better readability.

for (int i = 0; i < orderCount; i++) → Loops through all orders in the manager.

orders[i]->print(); → Calls each order’s print function to display details.

std::cout << "----------------\n"; → Prints a separator between orders.

Purpose
This function ensures all orders are displayed neatly, helping users check their placed orders.

std::cout << "MENU:\n"; → Prints the word "MENU" to indicate the list.

for (int i = 0; i < menuSize; i++) → Loops through all available menu items.

std::cout << i << ". " << menu[i].name << " ($" << menu[i].price << ")\n"; → Prints each item's number, name, and price.

DineInOrder* dineIn = new DineInOrder(); → Creates a new dine-in order using new, meaning it is stored dynamically in memory.

dineIn->addItem(0); → Adds a Burger (item 0 in the menu) to the order.

dineIn->addItem(3); → Adds a Soda (item 3 in the menu) to the order.

manager.addOrder(dineIn); → Stores the dine-in order inside the OrderManager, so it can be tracked and printed later.

Purpose
This ensures the dine-in order includes food items and is stored properly in the order manager.

DeliveryOrder* delivery = new DeliveryOrder(); → Creates a new delivery order dynamically in memory.

delivery->addItem(1); → Adds Pizza (item 1 from the menu) to the order.

delivery->addItem(2); → Adds Salad (item 2 from the menu) to the order.

manager.addOrder(delivery); → Stores the delivery order inside OrderManager, so it can be printed or tracked later.

Purpose
This ensures the delivery order is correctly stored in the system with its selected items.

manager.printAll(); → Calls the function to print all placed orders.

return 0; → Ends the program, signaling that it ran successfully.

Purpose
Displays all stored orders, including their details.

Ensures the program runs smoothly and exits properly.       
                
               THIS IS THE END
