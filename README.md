THIS IS A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF EACH LINE OF THE ENTILE PROGRAM THAT FOLLOWS:

1.	#include <iostream>: This line tells the computer to include a library that helps with input and output, like showing messages on the screen.
2.	using namespace std;: This line allows us to use standard commands without typing std:: every time.
3.	int main() {: This line defines the main function, which is where the program starts. It returns an integer.
4.	cout << "Hello, World!";: This line shows the message "Hello, World!" on the screen.
5.	return 0;: This line ends the main function and tells the computer the program ran successfully.
6.	}: This closing brace marks the end of the main function.
In short: This program prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
Example 2
1.	#include <iostream>: This line includes a library for input and output.
2.	using namespace std;: This line lets us use standard commands without std::.
3.	int main() {: This line starts the main function.
4.	int age = 20;: This line creates an integer variable called age and sets it to 20.
5.	double price = 19.99;: This line creates a double variable called price and sets it to 19.99.
6.	char grade = 'A';: This line creates a character variable called grade and sets it to 'A'.
7.	string name = "Alice";: This line creates a string variable called name and sets it to "Alice".
8.	cout << "Name: " << name << endl;: This line shows "Name: " followed by the name variable.
9.	cout << "Age: " << age << endl;: This line shows "Age: " followed by the age variable.
10.	cout << "Price: $" << price << endl;: This line shows "Price: $" followed by the price variable.
11.	cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;: This line shows "Grade: " followed by the grade variable.
12.	return 0;: This line ends the main function.
13.	}: This closing brace marks the end of the main function.
In short: This program prints the values of different types of variables.
Example 3
1.	#include <iostream>: This line includes a library for input and output.
2.	using namespace std;: This line lets us use standard commands without std::.
3.	int main() {: This line starts the main function.
4.	string name;: This line creates a string variable called name for the user's name.
5.	int age;: This line creates an integer variable called age for the user's age.
6.	cout << "Enter your name: ";: This line asks the user to enter their name.
7.	cin >> name;: This line takes the user's input and stores it in the name variable.
8.	cout << "Enter your age: ";: This line asks the user to enter their age.
9.	cin >> age;: This line takes the user's input and stores it in the age variable.
10.	cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;: This line shows a message with the user's name and age.
11.	return 0;: This line ends the main function.
12.	}: This closing brace marks the end of the main function.
In short: This program asks for the user's name and age and then displays a message with that information.
Example 4
1.	int a = 10, b = 3;: This line creates two integer variables a and b with values 10 and 3.
2.	cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl;: This line shows the sum of a and b.
3.	cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl;: This line shows the difference between a and b.
4.	cout << "Product: " << a * b << endl;: This line shows the product of a and b.
5.	cout << "Quotient: " << a / b << endl;: This line shows the quotient of a divided by b.
6.	cout << "Remainder: " << a % b << endl;: This line shows the remainder when a is divided by b.
In short: This program performs basic arithmetic operations with two numbers and displays the results.
Example 5
1.	int age = 18;: This line creates an integer variable called age and sets it to 18.
2.	if (age >= 18) {: This line checks if age is 18 or older.
3.	cout << "You are an adult." << endl;: If the condition is true, this line shows the message "You are an adult."
4.	}: This closing brace marks the end of the if statement.
In short: This program checks if a person is an adult and displays a message if they are.
